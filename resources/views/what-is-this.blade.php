            Symposium helps conference speakers plan and manage talk abstracts, CFP submissions, bios, photos, and
            speaking schedule.

                <p>
                    Track all of your talks, each with one or more versions (e.g. "Professional" vs. "Amateur" for
                    audience, or maybe "Lightning" vs. "Keynote" for length), and each version with a full revision
                    history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at which version of each talk you submitted to each conference, and how many times each talk
                    has been accepted and rejected.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-5 text-2xl text-indigo-800">Bios</h3>
                <p>Store and version multiple biographies for sending in with your talk submissions.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-5 text-2xl text-indigo-800">Photos</h3>
                <p>Store multiple revisions of your bio photos, ready to grab and upload with your talk submissions.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-5 text-2xl text-indigo-800">Conferences</h3>
                <p>
                    Find which conferences you're interested in applying to speak at; favorite them, track them, and get
                    reminders when their CFPs open and close.
                </p>
                <p>Track which conferences have accepted or rejected your talk submissions.</p>

                    Symposium helps conference organizers receive submissions (by allowing speakers to submit to any
                    conference powered by a CFP platform that's compatible with Symposium).
